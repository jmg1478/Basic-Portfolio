<strong><p>What is there to say about me? Am I your typical man's man? Or am I your typical nerd?</p></strong> 
    <p>To sum it up for you, I am a manly nerd! I can build a car from the ground up but I can also build a computer blindfolded. On a normal weekend, you will find me up in the mountains with my wife camping and hiking or hanging out with our families. I am from San Diego, Californa. I have lived here all my life but I have traveled a lot. Currently, I have been to almost every state and 6 different countries. My wife and I have the travel bug so we do travel often. I work in finance, mostly helping people in debt figure out a way to get out of it as painlessly as possible. The best part about work is that I work with my wife. On my down time, when I get it, I stream video games on Facebook. Mostly FPS (First Person Shooter) games. I have about 750 active followers spanning from the United States to India.<a href="https://www.facebook.com/VonKrakenGaming/">Click here to my Facebook page</a></p>
    <p>I grew up being told "I can do anything" so I have led my life by that. Nothing you want ever comes easily and you always have to work for it. Being a do'er has always been my strong suit. When I am not able to figure something out I take a step back and reanalyze the issue, look it up, or ask someone. There is always going to be someone smarter than you in life so use that to your advantage. I surround myself with people who are smarter and stronger than me so I can, hopefully, one day be on their level. Like the old saying goes <i>"you are the company you keep"</i>.</p>
    <strong><p>The reason I am interested in this class and possible career change is a long story but it's honestly a big part of why I am me.</p></strong>
    <p>When I was 19 I was in a motorcycle accident leading me to lose most of the feeling in my right leg and have to relearn how to walk with it. After I left the hospital I was placed on bed rest for just under 6 months. I couldn't do much on my own. I was a hard-headed, did whatever I wanted whenever I wanted type of teenager that had to learn to rely on his mom for just about everything. It was rough for a while, and I fell into depression and gained a lot of weight. One of my friends at the time noticed I was falling into a dark slump and came over one day to teach me how to build computers. This simple act changed my life. I fell in love with building computers and that is what lead me to where I am now.</p>
    <P><b>Words of advice.</b> <i style="color:purple">There is nothing we can't do as long as we take that first step in doing.</i></P>
